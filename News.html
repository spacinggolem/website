    <p>Psyonix announced the new update that will be coming with the start of the new season! This update will include the season
      rewards and a new crate. It will also include a soft reset, wich means you will have to play 10 placement matches in
      every gamemode to get your rank back. For further information, visit
      <a href="https://www.rocketleague.com/news/patch-notes-v1-41/">Psyonix's website</a> .</p>

    <h1>New name, new team!</h1>
    <img src="img/Logo.png" alt='logo'>

    <p>Individuals improve, but natural chemistry doesn't change much. Players always play best when they do what feels most
      comfortable, and certain team compositions won't allow you to do that. There's no reason not to disband and find another
      combination of players that works well. I enjoyed every match we played as a team but we just don't fit together anymore.
      That's why I decided to leave NRG and join Memento Mori. Also I changed my name, I felt Squishy(muffinz) was too childish.
      , thanks for all the support!</p>

    <p>Just two short months ago, we watched from the edge of our seats as Gale Force Esports won the Rocket League World Championship
      live from Washington DC. Unforgettable moments like those are what we love about the Rocket League Championship Series
      (RLCS), and we're back to bring you more with Season 5!</p>
